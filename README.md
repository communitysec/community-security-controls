# community-security-controls
An open source repository of community-maintained information security controls. Contains controls mapped to other frameworks as well as community best practices. Also contains additional detail that other controls frameworks typically don't, such as:

* Recommended tools and processes
* Threat models

So it's easier to understand what a control helps protect against (and doesn't) as well as specific ways to implement said control by leveraging the latest best practices crowdsourced from the information security community.
